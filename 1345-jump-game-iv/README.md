# 1345. Jump Game IV

Given an array of&nbsp;integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

In one step you can jump from index i to index:

	i + 1 where:&nbsp;i + 1 &lt; arr.length.
	i - 1 where:&nbsp;i - 1 &gt;= 0.
	j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.

Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]
Output: 3
Explanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --&gt; 4 --&gt; 3 --&gt; 9. Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [7]
Output: 0
Explanation: Start index is the last index. You do not need to jump.

Example 3:

Input: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.

&nbsp;
Constraints:

	1 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 5 * 104
	-108 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 108
